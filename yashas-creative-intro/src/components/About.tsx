        As a Front-End Web Developer, I specialize in crafting responsive and user-friendly websites using HTML/CSS and version control with Git/GitHub. I am currently applying these skills as an SDE Intern at Syntellite, translating technical requirements into real-world solutions.This practical experience is built on my pre-final year studies in Information Science Engineering, which have provided me with a robust understanding of Python, Java, DBMS, and Operating Systems. I am a passionate open-source enthusiast committed to continuous learning and building impactful technology.
